 <h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

    <p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.<This/p>

    <p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

    <p>ngredients</p>

    <ul>

    <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
    <ul>175g of tahini</ul>
    <li>6 sundriedz tomatoes</li>
    <li>Half a red pepper</li>    
    <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1 clove of garlic</li>  
    <li>A dash of olive oil</li>  </ul>

 <h2>Instructions</h2>   

  <p> <li> Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
   <li> Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely </li>
    <li> Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
    <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste. </li>
    <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
    <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time </li>
</p>

   <p> <li>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you </li>

    <h2>Storage</h2>
    
     <li> Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</li>
 
     <li>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</li> </p>
